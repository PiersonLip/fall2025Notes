\section{Polar}
\[x \rightarrow r\cos(\theta)\]
\[y \rightarrow r\sin(\theta)\]
\[da \rightarrow r dr d\theta \]
\[x^2 + y^2 = r^2\]

Converting Cords
\[x=\rho \sin\varphi \cos\theta\]
\[x=\rho \sin\varphi \sin\theta\]
\[z = \rho \cos \varphi\]

\[\rho^2 = x^2 + y^2 +z^2\]

To cylindrical \dots
\[r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\]
\[\theta = \arctan(\frac{y}{x})\]
\[z = z\]

To spherical \dots

\[r^2 = x^2 + y^2 +z^2\]
\[\theta = \arctan(\frac{y}{x})\]
\[\theta = \arccos(\frac{z}{\rho})\]

\section{Vector fields and such}

\[\text{A curve } C \text{ given by\dots} \quad r = \langle x(t), y(t) \rangle, \quad a \leq t \leq b \]

\[\int_C \sqrt{1+9xy} ds, \qquad C = r(t) = \langle t, t^3\rangle, \quad 0 \leq t \leq 1 \]

\[\int_{0}^{1} \sqrt{1+9t^4}\sqrt{1+9t^4} dr, \quad r(t)' = \langle 1,3t^2\rangle, \quad r(t)' = \sqrt{1+9t^4}\]

\[\int_{1}^{4} 1+9t^4\]
\[t+\frac{9t^5}{5}\big|_{0}^1\]
\[1+\frac{9}{5}\]


\subsection{Greens theorom}
\[\int_c Pdx + Qdy = \int \int_D \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} \frac{\partial P}{\partial Y} \mathrm{dxdy}\]
Example \dots
\[\int_{0}^{1}xy +y^2 dxdy \rightarrow \int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1} \frac{\partial }{\partial x}x^2 - \frac{\partial }{\partial y}xy \mathrm{ dxdy}\]

\[\int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1} 2x - x \mathrm{ dxdy} \]
\[\int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1} x \mathrm{ dxdy} \]
\[\int_{0}^{1} 1/2 \mathrm{dy} \]
\[= 1/2  \]
